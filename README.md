# First HTML Website – Capstone Project

This is my first personal website built using only HTML.  
It was created as part of an introductory web development course (Capstone Project 1) to demonstrate basic knowledge of HTML structure, page organization, and semantic markup.

The website includes a homepage, simple navigation links, and sections such as a short summary, hobbies, and a contact link.  
This project is the starting point for my journey into web development.

📁 Tech used:  
- HTML5  
- Semantic tags (header, section, footer, etc.)  
- Clean and accessible structure
